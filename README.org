* Zyzanie

Emacs-like key bindings in your browser!

And like emacs, you can rebind them on-the-fly!

=C-g= will cancel any started key sequence.

* Usage

Simply add =[zyzanie "0.1.0"]= in your project dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(global-set-key "C-c a" #(js/alert "Are you a global person?"))

(local-set-key "C-c a" #(js/alert "Local!") (domina/by-id "some-id"))
#+END_SRC

In the previous example, if you try "C-c a" from inside the dom
element "some-id", you will get the dialog:
: Local!

Anywhere else, "C-c a" will give you:
: Are you a global person?

You can easily make the same key sequence have different behavior
for different dom elements.

The local dom element must be focusable, otherwise the event won't be
fired by it.

You can use any dom element selector; here I use domina. The only
important part is to select the element that will fire the events.

** Rebinding

You can safely rebind any key sequence without the need to unset them
first.

Power to the REPL!

** Unset Key Sequence

You can unset key sequences with the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(global-unset-key "C-c a")

(local-set-key "C-c a" (domina/by-id "some-id"))
#+END_SRC
